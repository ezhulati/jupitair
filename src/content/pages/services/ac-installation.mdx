# Professional AC Installation in North Texas

When your air conditioner fails during a Texas summer, you need replacement fast. At Jupitair HVAC, we specialize in **same-week AC installations** that get your home cool again without the wait. Our owner-operated team has installed over 1,200 AC systems across Plano, Frisco, McKinney, and surrounding areas.

## Why Replace Your AC System?

Your AC system typically needs replacement when:
- **Age exceeds 12-15 years** - Older systems lose efficiency and reliability
- **Repair costs exceed $2,500** - Major repairs often signal imminent failure
