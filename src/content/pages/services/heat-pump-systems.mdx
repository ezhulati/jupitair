## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do heat pumps work in North Texas winters?**
A: Absolutely! Heat pumps work efficiently down to 35°F, which covers 95% of our winter days. For extreme cold, dual fuel systems add gas backup.

**Q: How long do heat pumps last?**
A: With proper maintenance, heat pumps last 12-15 years in North Texas. Our mild climate extends their lifespan.

**Q: Are heat pumps really more efficient?**
A: Yes! Heat pumps are 200-300% efficient because they move heat rather than create it. Gas furnaces max out at 96% efficiency.

**Q: What about those few freezing days?**
A: Heat pumps work fine above 35°F. Below that, auxiliary heat kicks in, or consider a dual fuel system for ultimate efficiency.
