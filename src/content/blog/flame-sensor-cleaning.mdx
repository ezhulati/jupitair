# Flame Sensor Cleaning: When and How

The flame sensor is a critical safety component in your gas furnace that detects when the burner is properly lit. When it becomes dirty or corroded, your furnace may short cycle, fail to ignite, or shut down unexpectedly. Learning proper cleaning techniques can restore reliable operation and prevent costly service calls in North Texas's demanding heating season.

**Key Safety Points:**
- Always turn off gas and electrical power before beginning work
- Flame sensors are delicate - handle with extreme care
- Use only appropriate cleaning materials to avoid damage
- Professional inspection recommended if problems persist
- Improper installation can create dangerous conditions
- Annual cleaning prevents most flame sensor failures


## Understanding Your Flame Sensor


### What is a Flame Sensor?

The flame sensor is a metal rod that extends into your furnace's combustion chamber. When gas ignites, the flame creates an electrical current between the sensor and the grounded burner assembly. This current signals the control board that combustion is occurring safely.

**How Flame Sensors Work:**
- Detect presence of flame through electrical conductivity
- Send microamperage signal to control board
- Allow continued gas flow only when flame is detected
- Shut off gas valve if flame is not sensed within 4-10 seconds
- **Critical safety function prevents gas accumulation**

**Common Flame Sensor Problems:**
- Carbon buildup from incomplete combustion
- Corrosion from moisture and condensation
- Physical damage from improper handling
- Loose electrical connections
- Incorrect positioning relative to flame
