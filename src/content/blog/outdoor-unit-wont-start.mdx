# Outdoor Unit Won't Start: Capacitor vs Contactor

When your AC outdoor unit fails to start on a hot North Texas day, the problem often lies with two critical electrical components: the capacitor or the contactor. Understanding how to distinguish between these failures can save you time and money while ensuring you get cooling restored quickly. This comprehensive guide will help you safely diagnose the issue and know when professional help is required.

**Key Diagnostic Points:**
- Capacitor failures often cause humming sounds without fan or compressor operation
- Contactor problems typically result in complete electrical silence
- Both components are stressed by North Texas heat and electrical storms
- Visual inspection can often identify the failed component
- Professional replacement ensures safety and proper operation
- Preventive maintenance significantly reduces failure rates


## Understanding Your Outdoor Unit Components


### The AC Capacitor: Energy Storage for Motor Startup

The capacitor stores and releases electrical energy to start your AC's motors. Think of it as a temporary battery that provides the extra power boost needed to overcome motor inertia during startup.

**Types of Capacitors:**
- **Start capacitor:** Provides initial motor starting torque
- **Run capacitor:** Maintains motor efficiency during operation
- **Dual capacitor:** Combines start and run functions for both fan and compressor
- **Most North Texas units use dual capacitors for space efficiency**

**How Capacitors Fail:**
- Internal breakdown from heat and electrical stress
- Moisture infiltration causing short circuits
- Aging electrolyte leading to reduced capacity
- Physical damage from electrical surges

### The Contactor: Electrical Switch for High-Voltage Control

The contactor is essentially a heavy-duty electrical switch that controls power to your outdoor unit's major components. When your thermostat calls for cooling, it sends a low-voltage signal that activates the contactor.

**Contactor Components:**
- **Electromagnetic coil:** Creates magnetic field when energized
- **Contact points:** Metal contacts that close to complete electrical circuit
- **Springs:** Return contacts to open position when power is removed
- **Housing:** Protects internal components from weather and debris

**Common Contactor Problems:**
- Burned or pitted contact points
- Stuck contacts that won't open or close
- Failed electromagnetic coil
- Mechanical wear from repeated cycling

## Distinguishing Capacitor vs. Contactor Failures


### Capacitor Failure Symptoms

**Characteristic Sounds:**
- **Humming or buzzing** from outdoor unit
- Sound occurs when AC is turned on
- Humming continues without fan or compressor starting
- **Most reliable indicator of capacitor failure**

**Operational Symptoms:**
- Fan motor attempts to start but fails
- Compressor tries to start but can't overcome inertia
- Circuit breaker may trip from motor overload
- **Unit draws excessive electrical current**

**Visual Indicators:**
- Bulged or swollen capacitor case
- Leaked electrolyte around capacitor
- Burned or corroded terminals
- **Physical damage visible on capacitor**

### Contactor Failure Symptoms

**Sound Characteristics:**
- **Complete silence** when AC should be running
- No humming, clicking, or motor sounds
- Thermostat calls for cooling but unit doesn't respond
- **Absence of sound is key diagnostic clue**

**Electrical Symptoms:**
- No power reaching outdoor unit components
- 24-volt control signal present but no response
- Indoor unit may run but outdoor unit completely inactive
- **Total electrical disconnect between control and load**

**Visual Inspection Findings:**
- Burned or pitted contact points
- Contacts stuck in open or closed position
- Discolored or melted contactor housing
- **Physical damage to electrical connections**


## Safe Diagnostic Steps for Homeowners


### Initial Safety Preparation

**Power Safety:**
1. Turn off AC at thermostat
2. Locate and turn off outdoor unit disconnect switch
3. Turn off circuit breaker at electrical panel
4. Use voltage tester to verify power is off
5. **Never skip electrical safety verification**

**Basic Visual Inspection:**
- Remove debris from around unit
- Check for obvious damage to electrical components
- Look for burned or melted wires
- Note any unusual odors
- **Do not remove electrical panels without professional help**

### Simple Diagnostic Tests

**Listen for Sounds:**
