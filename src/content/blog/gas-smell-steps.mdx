# Gas Smell From Furnace: What To Do First

**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION** - If you smell gas near your furnace or heating system, immediate action is required to protect your family and property. Gas leaks can lead to explosions, fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Follow these critical steps without delay.

**Emergency Action Summary:**
- **STOP** using electrical switches, appliances, or open flames immediately
- **EVACUATE** everyone from the building to a safe location outside
- **CALL** your gas utility emergency line first, then 911 if necessary
- **VENTILATE** by opening doors and windows only if safely accessible
- **WAIT** for professional gas technicians before re-entering


## IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE


### Step 1: STOP All Activities (Do This First)

**Critical - Do NOT:**
- Use light switches, electrical appliances, or garage door openers
- Create sparks with phones, doorbells, or any electrical devices
- Light matches, lighters, or candles
- Start vehicles or use power tools
- Use flashlights or any battery-powered devices

**Why This Matters:**
Natural gas is highly flammable and can ignite from the smallest spark. Even tiny electrical arcs from light switches can trigger explosions when gas concentrations reach dangerous levels.

### Step 2: EVACUATE Immediately

**Get Everyone Out:**
- Alert all occupants using voice only (no intercoms or alarms)
- Leave doors and windows open as you exit if safely accessible
- Move at least 350 feet away from the building
- Account for all family members and pets
- Do not re-enter for any reason until cleared by professionals

**Safe Assembly Point:**
- Choose a location upwind from your home
- Stay away from vehicles and other potential ignition sources
- Remain together and calm
- Have someone designated to call for help

## FAQ: Gas Emergency Response


**Q: How can I tell the difference between a gas leak and other odors?**
A: Natural gas has a distinctive "rotten egg" smell added by utilities for safety. This mercaptan odorant is unmistakable once you've smelled it. However, don't rely on smell alone - some gas leaks can be odorless, especially outdoors.

**Q: Is it safe to use my cell phone during a gas leak?**
A: Once you're safely outside and away from the building, cell phones are safe to use. Avoid using any devices inside the building where gas may be present.

**Q: What if I smell gas but it's very faint?**
A: Any gas odor requires immediate professional attention. Even faint smells can indicate dangerous conditions that could worsen rapidly. Don't wait to see if it gets stronger.

**Q: Can I turn off the gas myself?**
A: Only if you can safely reach the main gas shutoff valve outside without going through areas where gas smell is present. Turn clockwise to shut off. However, leave the house first and call professionals.

**Q: How long does it take for gas to dissipate?**
A: This depends on ventilation, gas concentration, and leak source. Natural gas is lighter than air and rises, but pockets can form in low ventilation areas. Only professionals should determine when it's safe.

**Q: What if my furnace has been making strange sounds?**
A: Unusual sounds combined with any gas odor requires immediate shutdown and professional inspection. Never ignore potential warning signs, especially during heating season.

**Q: Should I open windows during a gas leak?**
A: Only if you can safely access them without creating sparks or going through high-concentration gas areas. Opening windows can help, but evacuation is the priority.

**Q: What happens if gas service is shut off during winter?**
A: Utilities prioritize emergency restoration, but complex repairs can take days. We provide emergency temporary heating solutions to keep your family safe and comfortable during extended outages.

**Q: How often should I have my gas appliances inspected?**
A: Annual inspections are recommended, with additional checks if you notice any warning signs. In North Texas, schedule fall inspections before peak heating season begins.

**Q: What should I do if I suspect my neighbor has a gas leak?**
A: Call the gas utility emergency line immediately and evacuate your own home if the smell is detectable at your property. Gas can travel through soil and building structures.
