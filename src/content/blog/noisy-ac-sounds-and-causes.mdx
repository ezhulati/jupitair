- Look for ice on lines or water near the air handler.
- Note any error codes.

- Control settings or failed sensors.



## Safe checks you can do

- Clear debris around outdoor unit.
- Gently rinse outdoor coil with water if dusty.
- Photograph any error codes to share with tech.



## When to stop and call

- Burning smell or sparking.
- Water near electrical parts.
- Ice formation.
- Repeated breaker trips.



## How a tech will diagnose

- Static pressure and airflow tests.
- Capacitor/contactor/motor tests.
- Refrigerant readings (superheat/subcool).
- Control board and thermostat checks.
- Drain performance inspection.



## Prevent a repeat

- Right filter and schedule.
- Fix duct static and add returns if needed.
- Seasonal tune‑ups with coil cleaning and drain service.
