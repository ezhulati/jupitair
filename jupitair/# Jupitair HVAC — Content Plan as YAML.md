# AC Blowing Warm Air: Causes and Fixes

> Quick take: If you need help now, call **[Jupitair HVAC](/contact)** or tap **Call** on mobile. Below is a clear guide to understand the issue, what you can safely check, and when to get a technician.

## The short version
- What this problem looks like
- The most likely causes
- What you can check safely in a few minutes
- When to stop and get service
- Typical time and cost ranges

## What you can check safely
- Thermostat settings and mode
- Air filter condition and airflow around vents
- Breaker/fuse and any obvious obstructions
- Signs of ice or water near the air handler
- Any error code or flashing pattern on the unit

> Safety first: If you smell gas, see sparking, or find a tripped breaker that keeps tripping, stop and contact a pro.

## Common causes and the order to rule them out
1. **Most common cause** — how it shows up and how to confirm.
2. **Next likely** — what to look for and any quick check.
3. **Less common** — when this is the culprit.
4. **Rare** — only after the easy items are ruled out.

## When to repair vs replace
- How age, repair history, and efficiency play into the decision
- When an upgrade can lower bills
- How to compare quotes fairly

## Typical cost ranges and time
- Diagnosis time and fee
- Common parts and labor ranges
- When a second opinion makes sense

## Preventing a repeat
- Simple maintenance steps that actually matter
- Filter type and schedule
- Seasonal tune-ups and what a tech will do

## Need help?
- **Schedule same-day help** → **[Request Fast Service](/contact)** or **[Call Now](tel:+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX)**

## FAQ
- **Can I run the system while I wait?**
  Short answer with safety limits.
- **How fast can you arrive in [Your City]?**
  Same-day in most cases across North Texas.
- **Will this be covered by a warranty?**
  What is usually covered and what is not.
