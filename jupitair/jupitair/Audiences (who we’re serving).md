Absolutely. Here’s the **world-class 2025 content system** to turn Jupitair into *the* authoritative HVAC hub for North Texas. I’m giving you a full, end-to-end plan: audience → funnel → taxonomy → URL design → 12-month roadmap → briefs → schema → ops → KPIs.

> Quick note: I won’t ignore robots.txt or ToS. It’s risky and unnecessary. We’ll still win by extracting **structures/patterns** from allowed pages and public docs, then writing original, better material. That also aligns with Google’s quality guidance on E-E-A-T and helpful content. ([Google for Developers][1])

# 1) Audiences (who we’re serving)

**Residential**

* New homeowner (first HVAC issue; needs basics + trust).
* Experienced homeowner (costs, maintenance schedules, DIY-safe steps).
* “Emergency now” homeowner (no cool/heat; wants phone number + ETA).
* Health-sensitive household (IAQ, filtration, humidity, allergies).
* Budget-limited homeowner (repair vs replace, financing, rebates/tax credits). ([IRS][2], [ENERGY STAR][3], [Texas Comptroller][4])

**Commercial**

* Small retail/restaurant (RTUs, uptime, service contracts).
* Office/property manager (multi-site maintenance, SLAs).
* Builder/GC (new installs, code/permits guidance; high-level info + contact).

**Influencers**

* Realtors (pre-sale tune-ups, inspection issues).
* Insurance adjusters (water damage from condensate leaks).

---

# 2) Funnel map (awareness → consideration → decision → post-purchase)

**Awareness (symptoms)**

* AC not cooling / short cycling / blowing warm air / ice on lines / water leak / bad smells / loud noises / error codes.
* Furnace not igniting / short cycling / CO safety / heat pump in defrost.

**Consideration (education)**

* Root causes, DIY-safe checks, when to call a pro.
* Cost ranges by fix; repair vs replace; **SEER2** efficiency basics; **A2L refrigerant transition** (R-454B/R-32) and what it means for homeowners; **IRA 25C tax credits & state rebates**. ([www1.eere.energy.gov][5], [The Department of Energy's Energy.gov][6], [US EPA][7], [IRS][2], [Texas Comptroller][4])

**Decision (conversion)**

* Local proof (reviews, case studies), financing, scheduling, coupons, “What to expect on today’s visit”.

**Post-purchase (retention)**

* Seasonal maintenance guides, filter calendars, tune-up reminders, warranty care.

# 9) Content quality & compliance (how we win)

* Follow Google’s **helpful content** and **E-E-A-T** playbooks; add real expertise (licensed author or reviewed by one). ([Google for Developers][1])
* Use **Schema.org `HVACBusiness`** for local pages; `Service` and `FAQPage` where relevant; `BreadcrumbList` site-wide. ([Schema.org][9])
* Keep pages fast; **INP** is now a Core Web Vital (FID retired March 2024). ([Google for Developers][10], [web.dev][11])
* Cite authoritative sources (DOE/EPA/IRS/EnergyStar/Oncor/Texas SECO) for standards, credits, rebates. ([www1.eere.energy.gov][5], [US EPA][7], [IRS][2], [ENERGY STAR][3], [Texas Comptroller][4])
* No copying competitor text or images. We can study their **structures** (headings, word counts, schema, IA) legally.

---

# 10) Internal linking model

* **Hub → Spokes**: every pillar links to all symptom/cost/maintenance pages.
* **Spoke → Hub**: each spoke links up to its pillar and sideways to sibling posts.
* **Service pages**: link out to relevant educational posts and back.
* **City pages**: deep-link to local educational posts (“AC leaking water in Frisco”).
* **Breadcrumbs**: category → sub-category → article.

* EPA AIM Act factsheet (HFC phasedown; sector timelines incl. HVAC 2025–2026). ([US EPA][7])
* IRS Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C; \$2,000 annual heat pump cap). ([IRS][2])
* ENERGY STAR overview of credits. ([ENERGY STAR][3])
* Texas SECO IRA page (HOMES/HEAR rebates; Texas allocation). ([Texas Comptroller][4])
* Oncor Home Energy Efficiency programs (rebates run seasonally; HVAC eligible measures). ([oncor-www][8])
* Google’s Helpful Content + E-E-A-T guidance; AI-content stance. ([Google for Developers][1])
