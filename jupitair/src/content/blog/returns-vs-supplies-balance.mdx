# Return vs Supply Balance



## Solving Hot/Cold Rooms
- Thermostat: correct mode and setpoint.
- Filter: replace if dirty.
- Breaker/fuse: reset once if safe. If it trips again, stop.
- Look for ice on lines or water near the air handler.
- Note any error codes.

## Likely causes
- Airflow restrictions (filter, ducts, coil).
- Electrical parts (capacitor, contactor, sensors).
- Charge or metering issues.
- Control settings or failed sensors.


## Safe checks you can do
- Replace filter; open closed vents.
- Clear debris around outdoor unit.
- Gently rinse outdoor coil with water if dusty.
- Photograph any error codes to share with tech.


## When to stop and call
- Burning smell or sparking.
- Water near electrical parts.
- Ice formation.
- Repeated breaker trips.


## How a tech will diagnose
- Static pressure and airflow tests.
- Capacitor/contactor/motor tests.
- Refrigerant readings (superheat/subcool).
- Control board and thermostat checks.
- Drain performance inspection.


## Prevent a repeat
- Right filter and schedule.
- Fix duct static and add returns if needed.
- Seasonal tune‑ups with coil cleaning and drain service.


## FAQ
- **Is it safe to run with hot cold rooms hvac?** Not if there is ice, water, or burning smell.
- **Why did it happen now?** Often heat, dust, or a weak part under stress.
- **Will it resolve on its own?** The root cause needs correction.


## Safety notes
- Do not open sealed panels or handle refrigerant.
- Power off before touching any electrical cabinet.
- If unsure, stop and call a licensed technician.
